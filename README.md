# React QR Scanner

Forked from `@alzera/react-scanner`. [https://github.com/alzera/react-scanner.git]

This fork stores the users selected camera in localStorage, and puts a class `barcode-scanner__device-selector` on the `<select>` element for choosing the camera, so it can be styled with outside CSS.
